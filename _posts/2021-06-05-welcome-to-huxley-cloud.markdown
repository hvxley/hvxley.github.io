Cloud Huxley is an aspiring Software Developer from just outside of the Seattle
tech bubble. Within these pages, you will find a curation of skill sets, projects,
& experience in lieu of institutional training & academic assessments.

Also, within this CV you may find Art. Kurt Vonnegut famously wrote, <q>The arts are
not a good way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more
bearable,</q> and to that end Cloud's Academic History agrees.    

It is the intention of this site to connect to Cloud's mind&mdash; past & present&mdash;
by the deconstruction of thoughts into data, and through methodologies of dissemination.
